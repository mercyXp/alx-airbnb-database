# 🏠 ALX Airbnb Database Project

## 📖 About the Project

This project is part of the comprehensive **ALX Airbnb Database Module**, focusing on **database design, normalization, schema creation, and seeding**. By working through these tasks, you'll design and build a robust relational database for an Airbnb-like application — ensuring **scalability**, **efficiency**, and **real-world functionality**.

This project simulates a **production-level database system**, emphasizing high standards in design, development, and data handling.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

As a professional developer, completing these tasks will empower you to:

- ✅ Apply advanced principles of database design to model complex systems.
- ✅ Master the art of normalization to optimize database efficiency and minimize redundancy.
- ✅ Use SQL DDL to define database schema with appropriate constraints, keys, and indexing for performance.
- ✅ Write and execute SQL DML scripts to seed databases with realistic sample data.
- ✅ Enhance collaboration skills by managing repositories, documenting processes, and adhering to professional standards.

## 🧰 Requirements

To successfully complete this project, you should:

- 📌 Have a strong foundation in **relational databases** and **SQL**.
- 📌 Be proficient in using **Draw.io** or similar tools for visual modeling.
- 📌 Understand data normalization principles, especially up to **3rd Normal Form (3NF)**.
- 📌 Be comfortable working with **GitHub** repositories for documentation and submission.
- 📌 Follow **industry best practices** for database design and scripting.

## ✨ Key Highlights

### ✅ Task 1: Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
- Create a detailed ERD to visualize the database structure.
- Ensure clear relationships and well-defined entities.

### ✅ Task 2: Normalization
- Apply normalization techniques (up to 3NF).
- Refine the design to ensure minimal redundancy and high data integrity.

### ✅ Task 3: SQL Schema Creation
- Write SQL DDL scripts to define the schema.
- Include constraints, **primary/foreign keys**, and **indexes** for optimal performance.

### ✅ Task 4: Data Seeding
- Populate your database with realistic sample data.
- Simulate a functional Airbnb-like environment: users, listings, bookings, payments.
